    who was spreading his malicious magic across the land.

    The people were living in fear, and the world was slowly disappearing into the void.
    But one day, a hero appeared, a hero who was destined to save the world and defeat the lord.

    Some people tought she was Mark, the legendary hero who was foretold to save the world from the darkness. 
    But no, she was not Mark, but that doesn't means Mark didn't exist in her...
